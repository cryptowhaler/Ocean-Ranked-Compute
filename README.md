## BASIC SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
1. Barge is a shell script allowing you to run an Ocean network by orchestrating all core components locally with Docker and Docker Compose.

2. If you are not getting the front-end on localhost:3000, chances are you have set 2 GB RAM in your Docker Advanced Resources settings. Change this to 4 GB RAM. Docker/Preferences/Resources - Make the memory >= 4GB.
